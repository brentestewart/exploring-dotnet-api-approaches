## What is an API?

- Application Programming Interface 
- A way for software to ask another system to do something or provide data
- Defines the interface that callers use, separating usage from implementation details.
- Analogy: **C# interface** — describes just the behavior without implementation

---

## What an API is NOT

- Not just HTTP
- Not just JSON
- Not always public or external
- Not always synchronous or request/response

---

## Why Use APIs

- Separation of concerns
- Allow internal changes without breaking consumers
- Enable reuse across multiple clients
- Create natural team and system boundaries
- Support distribution and scaling

---

## Legacy API Technologies

| Technology | Introduced |
|------------|------------|
| COM / DCOM | Pre-.NET / 1990s |
| ASMX Web Services (SOAP) | .NET 1.0 / 2002 |
| .NET Remoting | .NET 1.0 / 2002 |
| WCF | .NET 3.0 / 2006 |

---

## Modern API Options

| Technology | Introduced |
|------------|------------|
| Controller-based APIs | Framework 4.5 |
| SignalR (Real-time) | ASP.NET Core 2.0 |
| OData | ~ASP.NET Core 3 |
| gRPC | .NET Core 3.0 |
| Azure Functions | 2016–2017 |
| Minimal APIs | .NET 6 |
| Message-based APIs | 2004–2018 |

## Controller-based APIs

- Structured, controller-centric API model
- Built on **ASP.NET Core MVC**
- Uses attributes for routing (`[HttpGet]`, `[HttpPost]`, etc.)
- Explicit request/response handling

---

## Controller-based APIs (When / Why to Use)

- CRUD-heavy APIs
- Larger teams or long-lived services
- APIs needing cross-cutting features (auth, logging, validation)
- When you want **structure and discoverability**

---

## Controller-based APIs

**Demo Time!**

---

## Minimal APIs

- Lightweight API model introduced in **.NET 6**
- No controllers; routes defined directly in `Program.cs`
- Quick to spin up endpoints for simple services
- Focused on **simplicity and speed**

---

## Minimal APIs<br/>(When / Why to Use)

- Small services or microservices
- Prototyping or experiments
- When you don’t need full MVC structure
- Easy to integrate with minimal ceremony

---

## Minimal APIs

**Demo Time!**

---

## gRPC

- High-performance RPC framework
- Contract-first: messages and services defined in `.proto` files
- Uses HTTP/2 for streaming and efficiency
- Strongly typed, ideal for inter-service communication

---

## gRPC<br/>(When / Why to Use)

- Microservices communication
- Real-time streaming between services
- Low-latency, high-throughput scenarios
- When you need strict contracts and type safety

---

## gRPC

**Demo Time!**

---

## OData

- Enables rich, queryable REST endpoints  
- Supports `$filter`, `$select`, `$expand`, `$orderby` out of the box  
- Lets clients control what data they retrieve  
- Ideal for APIs with complex relationships  

---

## OData<br/>(When / Why to Use)

- APIs where clients need flexible queries  
- CRUD APIs with complex relationships  
- When you want to reduce server-side query endpoints  
- Useful for reporting, dashboards, or client-driven data access  

---

## OData

**Demo Time!**
